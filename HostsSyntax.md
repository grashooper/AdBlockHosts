#summary Syntax of Hosts files

= Introduction =

A line contains the IP address and the corresponding hostname. Lines starting with a # are comment lines. In our case specific hostnames should be blocked, means should be forwarded to our own local IP address (127.0.0.1) or a choosen one.

  * !AdAway will strip all localhost entries and adds its own

  * !AdAway will use only the hostnames having a IP address 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 for blocking and all other as redirection rules

  * The Parser in !AdAway will check that every line contains a real hostname, if not it will ignore that line

  * !AdAway will merge all given hosts files into one file, duplicates will be ignored
