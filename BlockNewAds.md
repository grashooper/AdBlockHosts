#summary What to do if you have ads in your favorite application?

= Introduction =

I get many emails about Apps that still display advertisements. But I don't have any time to help you to get rid of them. So please follow this guide.

## Guide

  # Start AdAway and go to the "Log DNS Requests" screen
  # Start Tcpdump from there
  # Open the App with Advertisements and play around with it for some time.
  # Go back to AdAway's Tcpdump screen and open the log file.
  # There you look out for suspicious hostnames.
  # Try to block some of them by adding them to your Blacklist from that screen (long press a hostname) and restart your Android device.
  # If it helped and you are totally sure, which hostname served the ads, please report the hostname(s) in the Forum [http://forum.hosts-file.net/viewforum.php?f=9 Hosts Inbox] of [http://hosts-file.net] or in our [http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/entry Issue tracker].

## Other things to do?
  * If you didn't succeed following the guide, you can also try to add a new issue and hope that somebody will help you: [http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/entry Add issue]
  * Some apps have bundled the advertisments. Thus you will never get rid of them by using AdAway.
