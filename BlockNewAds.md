I get many emails about Apps that still display advertisements. But I don't have any time to help you to get rid of them. So please follow this guide.

## Guide

1. Start AdAway and go to the "Log DNS Requests" screen
2. Start Tcpdump from there
3. Open the App with Advertisements and play around with it for some time.
4. Go back to AdAway's Tcpdump screen and open the log file.
5. There you look out for suspicious hostnames.
6. Try to block some of them by adding them to your Blacklist from that screen (long press a hostname) and restart your Android device.
7. If it helped and you are totally sure, which hostname served the ads, please report the hostname(s) in the Forum [Hosts Inbox](http://forum.hosts-file.net/viewforum.php?f=9) of [http://hosts-file.net](http://hosts-file.net) or in our [Issue tracker](https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/issues).

## Other things to do?
  * If you didn't succeed following the guide, you can also try to add a new issue and hope that somebody will help you: [Add issue](https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/issues)
  * Some apps have bundled the advertisments. Thus you will never get rid of them by using AdAway.
